# Word-Search-Matrix

This program will get the row and column from an input file, along with
the 2D matrix and the movie names, to ultimately find the list of movies
in the matrix. It will print out the location at which the movie is found and
in the direction at which it is found.

Additional Notes About the Program: 

1) Used a special feature for searching and removing spaces in movie name
2) For the movie "RUR", the code includes the instance where it happens twice, as it is a palindrome
3) Included a word.length() statement when searching for each word in matrix
